{"name":"Libsedml","tagline":"SED-ML library based on libSBML ","body":"# LibSEDML\r\nSome time ago I developed [libSedML](http://libsedml.sf.net) a C# library that fully supports [SED-ML](http://sed-ml.org) for SBML as well as CellML models for creation of the description just as for the execution of Simulation Experiments. However, frequently the question to a C++ based library comes up. This project makes use of [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) XML layer as well as code generation as starting point to produce a library for reading and writing of SED-ML models. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nThis library requires libSBML to be present, as its XML parsing layer will be used. for that either expat, xerces-c or libXML2 needs to be available. \r\n\r\n## Building \r\nThis library uses [CMake](http://cmake.org) to build the library, so from an initial checkout all you would need todo is to run: \r\n\r\n\r\n    mkdir build  \r\n    cd build\r\n    cmake -DLIBSBML_LIBRARY=< path to libsbml lib> -DLIBSBML_INCLUDE_DIR=< path to includes > ... -DEXTRA_LIBS= < comma separated list of xml libraries> \r\n    make  \r\n    make install\r\n    \r\nShould libSBML be installed in a default location it will be found automatically. Note that you do need to list the xml libraries that libSBML was linked against. In most cases libSBML is compiled against libXML and have compression enabled, so your `EXTRA_LIBS` would be:\r\n\r\n\tEXTRA_LIBS=xml2;bz2;z;iconv\r\n\r\nnote the semicolon denoting the listing of several libraries. Of course you could also enter the full path to each individual file, just to give an example, on windows I use: \r\n\r\n\tEXTRA_LIBS=D:/dependencies/lib/expat.lib\r\n\r\nfor linking against `expat` and indicating, that libSBML was compiled without compression.\r\n\r\n## License \r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Frank T.
